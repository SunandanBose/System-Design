Three concerns that are important in most software systems
## **Reliability**
> *The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance)* 
> *even in the face of adversity (hardware or software faults, and even human error)*

> If the application, performs the function that the user expected, tolerate user mistakes, prevent unauthorized access. Then we can say that
> the system is **working correctly**. We can then understand the term reliability as meaning, continuing to work correctly even when things go wrong.

> The things that go wrong are called faults. If a system is anticipating in faults and is able to recover is called **fault-tolerant** or
> **fault-resilient**

> A fault can also be defined as one component of the system deviated from its specs.

> A failure can be defined as when the system as a whole system stops providing the required service to the user.



## **Scalability**
> As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing 
> with that growth

## **Maintainability**
> Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current 
> behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.
